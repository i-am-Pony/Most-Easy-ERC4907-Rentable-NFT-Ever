# Most-Easy-ERC4907-Rentable-NFT-Ever
An easy version of the ERC4907 that doesn't allow sale if NFT is rented.
You will need the IERC4907 to serve as an interface.
The ERC 4907 Standars allows the separation of "owner" and "user" making new possibilities,
including the ability to allow a user to "rent" an NFT and use the utilities during rental period
while the owner retains ownership of said asset.
